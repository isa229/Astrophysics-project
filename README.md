Classification of Stars, Galaxies and quasars

This project consist of an exploratory data analysis of 10000 observations of astronomical objects taken by the SDSS. Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.
The goal is to create a machine learning algorithm that classifies correctly the objects based on the most important features.
